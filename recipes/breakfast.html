    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Delicious veggie-filled breakfast sandwiches. I make large batches of these and keep them in the freezer. Take one out the night before and let defrost in fridge. In the morning, just nuke and you have a yummy hot breakfast.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
        <li>4 vegetarian sausage patties</li>
        <li>4 ounces fresh mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup finely chopped fresh spinach</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch chili powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup egg whites</li>
        <li>½ cup low-fat cream cheese</li>
        <li>English muffins, split and toasted</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Spray a nonstick skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook patties until heated through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Spray skillet with more cooking spray. Saute mushrooms over medium heat until tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, garlic, Italian seasoning, chili powder, cayenne, salt, and pepper; stir until mixed.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in egg whites and stir lightly until combined. Cook until starting to set, 2 to 3 minutes. Lift edges and let uncooked egg flow underneath. Repeat until completely set, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and cut into 4 wedges.</li>
        <li>Spread cream cheese over English muffin halves. Sandwich a sausage patty and wedge of egg between each English muffin.</li>
    </ol>
